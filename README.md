# Nuclei Detection Challenge 

One of the aims of Biological Research is to cure the many diseases and ailments that plague our society. This research is crucial in developing cures and treatments for diseases such as various cancers, heart disease, Alzheimerâ€™s and many others. The outcomes of these treatments can have a profound positive effect on the well-being of the many individuals that are suffering from one of these diseases. Because of this, the speed of the research is crucial.  Our project aims to increase the speed of one component of this research: nucleus detection. By improving this one aspect of research we hope this will speed up the research process and help deliver cures faster.
